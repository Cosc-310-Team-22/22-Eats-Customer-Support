# 22-Eats-Customer-Support
### Explanation of Project
#### (From Sayo Everden's Project Plan)
In this project, Team 22 will develop an interactive conversational agent for a call center for food delivery service, T22 Eats. First, the agent will identify if a user is existing business partners( restaurant ) , existing customers or future partners. We will focus on the issue with the current orders from the existing customers in this project. After a caller selects the option for the existing customer and issues with the existing option, our conversational agent program will determine if the customer will get a refund or not with the objective of reducing the number of calls the human operators need to take by 20%.  The common issues include missing items, getting wrong items ,quality of items and taking too long to deliver. Then it will determine if the customer gets refunds, explain why you donâ€™t get a refund or connect the customer to the human operator.
